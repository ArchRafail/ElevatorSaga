# ElevatorSaga
Simple solution at each lvl of Elevator Saga
</br>
</br>
The game Elevator Saga You could find at - [play.elevatorsaga.com](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/).</br>
I propose You simple solution at each challenge of the game.</br>
</br>
Challenges 1-3 request quick elevator or elevators (more passengers by less time).</br>
The code could by find here - <a href="https://github.com/ArchRafail/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/challenges1-3.js">challenges1-3.js</a>.</br>
</br>
In challenge 4, the request was the same, but there are 2 elevators, so code from solution 1-3 was updated.</br>
The code could by find here - <a href="https://github.com/ArchRafail/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/challenge4.js">challenge4.js</a>.</br>
</br>
During challenge 5, the code from solution 4 was updated again. Request was the same: need quick elevators.</br>
The code could by find here - <a href="https://github.com/ArchRafail/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/challenge5.js">challenge5.js</a>.</br>
</br>
For solutions 6-7 was created new code, because the root of task were moves (more passengers by less moves). </br>
The code could by find here - <a href="https://github.com/ArchRafail/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/challenges6-7.js">challenges6-7.js</a>.</br>
</br>
Challenges 8-9 require short waiting time. So code was created by match this request (short waiting time for transporting passenger).</br>
The code could by find here - <a href="https://github.com/ArchRafail/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/challenges8-9.js">challenges8-9.js</a>.</br>
</br>
In challenge 10 we need quick elevators but we meet new type of elevator (by 10 passengers). So code from solution 4 was updated.</br>
The code could by find here - <a href="https://github.com/ArchRafail/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/challenge10.js">challenge10.js</a>.</br>
</br>
Challenge 11 was throw us the new issue, waiting time from solutions 8-9 was not enough. So code was updated again.</br>
Was used new strategy for these 5 elevators - unsynchonizing their moves from the start of challenge.</br>
The code could by find here - <a href="https://github.com/ArchRafail/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/challenge11.js">challenge11.js</a>.</br>
</br>
In challenge 12 I deeper updated code from solution 11. Waiting time was not enough again, so was created lists of up and down floors.</br>
The code could by find here - <a href="https://github.com/ArchRafail/ElevatorSaga/blob/main/challenge12.js">challenge12.js</a>.</br>
